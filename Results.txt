Test case 01
	
	Metrix A is 2x2 & Metrix B is 2x2.

	Runtime without threads = 5ms
	Runtime using threads = 15ms

Test case 02

	Metrix A is 8x8 & Metrix B is 8x8.

	Runtime without threads = 16ms
	Runtime using threads = 38ms

Test case 03

	Metrix A is 20x10 & Metrix B is 10x10.

	Runtime without threads = 15ms
	Runtime using threads = 35ms

Test case 04
	Metrix A is 200x100 & Metrix B is 100x50.

	Runtime without threads = 990ms
	Runtime using threads = 1011ms

Test case 05
	Metrix A is 1000x50 & Metrix B is 50x1000.

	Runtime without threads = 701ms
	Runtime using threads = 613ms


	some times runtime of using thread value is grater than without thread. Because may be final metrix print time is high and when using small metrix time is normaly higher than without threads.
